Explainer Script - Football Jersey Showcase Project
ICT171 Assignment 3 - Cloud Server Deployment


"Hello, my name is Parthiv, student ID 35859257, and this is my ICT171 Assignment 3 video explainer. Today, I'll walk you through how I deployed my Football Jersey Showcase website using Microsoft Azure Infrastructure as a Service, configured Apache web server on Ubuntu Linux, purchased and configured a domain name through GoDaddy, and linked everything together to create a live, accessible website."

 Part 1: Azure Virtual Machine Setup (2-3 minutes)

Setting Up the VM

First, I'll show you how I created my virtual machine on Microsoft Azure.

1. Logged into Azure Portal at portal.azure.com
2. Created a new Virtual Machine with these specifications:
   - VM Name: ict171-vm
   - Region: UAE North (to minimize latency for my location)
   - Operating System: Ubuntu Server 22.04 LTS
   - Size: Standard B1s (suitable for a static website)
   
3. Configured Authentication: I set up SSH using password

4. Network Configuration
   - Created a new Virtual Network
   - Configured Network Security Group to allow:
     - SSH (port 22) for remote access
     - HTTP (port 80) for web traffic
     - HTTPS (port 443) for secure connections

5. Public IP Address: Azure assigned me the static IP address **20.233.33.117**
   - This IP will be linked to my domain name later"


Now I'll demonstrate how I connected to my server and configured it.

Step 1: SSH Connection
bash
ssh azureuser@20.233.33.117
enter password

Once connected, the first thing I did was update the system:

sudo apt update
sudo apt upgrade -y

Step 2: Installing Apache Web Server

Apache is the web server software that will serve my website to visitors:

sudo apt install apache2 -y


After installation, I started and enabled Apache:
sudo systemctl start apache2
sudo systemctl enable apache2


I verified it was running:


sudo systemctl status apache2

At this point, if I visit my IP address 20.233.33.117 in a browser, I see the default Apache welcome page."

Configuring the Firewall

Step 3: Firewall Configuration

For security, I configured UFW (Uncomplicated Firewall):

sudo ufw allow OpenSSH
sudo ufw allow 'Apache Full'
sudo ufw enable
sudo ufw status

This allows only SSH and web traffic, blocking everything else."

Deploying Website Files

"**Step 4: Uploading Website Files**

I created my HTML files locally, then transferred them to the server.

First, I navigated to the web root directory:

cd /var/www/html

I removed the default Apache page:

sudo rm index.html


Then I uploaded my website files 


Now when I visit 20.233.33.117, I see my Football Jersey Showcase website!"


Part 3: Domain Name Configuration (3-4 minutes)

Purchasing Domain from GoDaddy

Step 1: Domain Purchase

To make my website more accessible and professional, I purchased a domain name from GoDaddy.

1. I went to GoDaddy.com
2. Searched for available domain names related to my project
3. Selected and purchased my domain ('parthiv.live')
4. Completed the purchase process(costed around 8 aed)

**Step 2: Linking Domain to Azure IP Address**

This is where we connect the domain name to our Azure server's IP address using DNS configuration.

In GoDaddy DNS Management:

1. Logged into my GoDaddy account
2. Navigated to My Products > Domains
3. Clicked DNS next to my domain name
4. Added/Modified DNS Records:

A Record Configuration:
- Type: A
- Name: @ (this represents the root domain)
- Value: 20.233.33.117 (my Azure server IP)
- TTL: (default option)

WWW Subdomain :
- Type: A
- Name: **www**
- Value: 20.233.33.117
- TTL: (default option)

5. Saved all changes


 Part 6: Testing and Verification (2 minutes)


Test 1: Access by IP Address
- Navigate to http://20.233.33.117
- Website loads successfully

Test 2: Access by Domain Name
- Navigate to http://parthiv.live
